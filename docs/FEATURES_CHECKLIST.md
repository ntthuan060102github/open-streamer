## Manual Test Matrix — Ingest × Publisher

**OK** = playback acceptable in manual test · **—** = not tested · **Issue** = visible stutter / lag

### Without internal transcoding

| Ingest (pull) | HLS | DASH |
|---------------|-----|------|
| File | OK | OK |
| HLS | OK | OK |
| RTMP | OK | OK |
| SRT | — | — |
| RTSP | — | — |

### With internal transcoding (FFmpeg ABR ladder)

| Ingest (pull) | HLS | DASH |
|---------------|-----|------|
| File | OK | OK |
| HLS | OK | OK |
| RTMP | OK | OK |
| SRT | — | — |
| RTSP | — | — |

### Push ingest

| Ingest (push) | HLS | DASH |
|---------------|-----|------|
| RTMP push (OBS/FFmpeg) | OK | OK |
| SRT push | — | — |

---

## Operational Assumptions

- **FFmpeg** must be on `PATH` (or set via `transcoder.ffmpeg_path`) for transcoding. Not required for passthrough / pure ingest.
- **HLS and DASH dirs must differ** when both publishers are active (`publisher.hls.dir` ≠ `publisher.dash.dir`).
- **DVR has no global enable/disable.** Each stream opt-in via `stream.dvr.enabled = true`.
- **Failover timestamp jumps** produce `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` in HLS and are logged at debug level from FFmpeg stderr.

*Updated against codebase state 2026-04-07 (Kafka hooks, full event wiring, FFmpeg auto-restart, exhausted-input detection, Prometheus metrics fully wired). Update this file when feature status changes.*
